We are the [Semmelweis University](http://semmelweis.hu/english/) Computational
Biology Group, located at the [1st Department of Pathology and Experimental
Cancer Research](http://semmelweis.hu/patologia1/en/).

We are interested bioinformatics, computational and systems biology and what
novel biological insight existing large-scale public datasets can reveal. Our
work is highly interdisciplinary, at the crossroad of biology, medicine,
informatics and data science.
